A new #microDrum [IRC](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) channel
has been created on [freenode](http://freenode.net/) for those who would like to
get in contact with other project users in real time.
You can choose to connect to it using an [IRC client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients)
or opening a [freenode web chat](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23microDrum)
page on your web browser.
